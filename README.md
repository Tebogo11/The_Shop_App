E-Com Shopping Application 

## How to access and use the Application
### Option 1
Option 1 will first require you to download the git repo and store it locally, Then run the cd HandBookApp in the root folder. Once in the folder open a terminal and run npm install, then run run npm start - This will start the client server. Once you finish booting up you will see a barcode on the screen, if not you can head to http://localhost:19002 and you should be able to find the barcode there. You will need the Expo Go mobile application on your phone, whether that's Android or IOS https://expo.io/client. Once thats downloaded head to your camera and scan the barcode

### Option 2 
The last option, follows the same steps as option option 1, but after you run npm start and the barcode is printed out, you look at the very bottom of the terminal script and you will see commands like “press a : android”. This option allows you to run the application on an emulator, Follow these link for IOS: https://docs.expo.io/workflow/ios-simulator/ . and this link for Android: https://docs.expo.io/workflow/android-studio-emulator/
